In many introductory computer programming classes,\
the first program that students learn to write just prints “Hello, world!”
It is used as a first assignment because it is a simple program that produces output.
The program dates back to at least 1974, when Brian Kernighan used it as an example in a C programming tutorial.
Its popularity has grown since then.
Louisiana Tech University's ACM chapter has a Hello World project\
that has collected versions of this program in almost 200 different computer languages.

While “Hello, World!” is a nice and simple first program, it does have one drawback.
The program says hello to the world, but the world does not respond!
This one-sided conversation is starting to become awkward after more than 35 years.
For this problem, write a program that returns greetings from the world to the program.

There is no input for this problem.

Print one line of output: The world says hello!
'''

print("The world says hello!")
